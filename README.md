# gift-wrapping-service
This is a proof of concept design for a gift wrapping service that can be used by a department store to provide its customers quotes for gift wrapping services.
It's also the first project that I completed.
The presents can be wrapped in three different shapes, and they can have to different patterns that each have a seperate price.
Variables that can affect the price are:
  1. The gift's shape (cube, cuboid or cylinder)
  2. Pattern 1 (default price) or pattern 2 (higher price)
  3. The addition of a gift tag (default price + amount per character)
  4. Whether the customer wants a bow or not.
